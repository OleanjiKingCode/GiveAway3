# Giveaway3 DApp ðŸ’¸
Welcome to Giveaway3, a decentralized application (DApp) built using Axelar SDK. Giveaway3 allows users to gift tokens from one blockchain to another seamlessly. Currently, only aUSDC is supported as the token for gifting. Users can send and receive tokens across different blockchains, including Fantom Testnet, Mumbai Polygon, and Arbitrum Sepolia.

## Features

- **Cross-Blockchain Token Gifting**: Users can easily gift aUSDC tokens from one supported blockchain to another.
- **Supported Blockchains**: Fantom Testnet, Mumbai Polygon, and Arbitrum Sepolia are supported for sending and receiving tokens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive, guiding users through the process step-by-step.
- **Transaction History**: A transaction history table displays all past transactions for reference.

## How to Use
 
1. **Select Chain and Enter Amount**: On the interface, users can select the blockchain they want to send tokens to and enter the amount of aUSDC they wish to gift.
2. **Approve Tokens**: Before initiating a gift transaction, users need to approve the tokens they wish to send. This ensures that the DApp has permission to transfer tokens on behalf of the user.
3. **Enter Recipient Addresses**: Users must enter the recipient addresses where they want to send the tokens.
4. **Send Tokens**: After entering the receipents addresses, users can proceed to send the tokens. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, it will reflect in the transaction history.
